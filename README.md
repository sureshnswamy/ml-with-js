This repo is inspired from [Abhishek Soni](https://github.com/abhisheksoni27/machine-learning-with-js).

This repo uses two libratires:
[Linear regression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ml-regression) which has couple of algorithams linear and polynomial. 
[csvtojson](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csvtojson) for converting csv data to json.



Run the following command to run your  model

$ node index.js

if you need the data for testing download the data file(.csv) from [here](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/Advertising.csv)
